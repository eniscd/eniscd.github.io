this is a portfolio website to showcase my projects in the future and with some details about me, futuring some links and stuff.

it is open source, so you can use it but idk this is my first html & css project and i dont really like the way i wrote it, plus im still learning html and css (i rarely check if im bored or smth)

so if i were you i would prolly make a better one or just find better open source portfolios on the internet.
