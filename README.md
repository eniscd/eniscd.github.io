This is my personal website where I showcase my projects, write about myself etc.

## Why didnt you buy a domain and host your website?
I actually bought a VPS and a domain but i cancelled both of them because im not really into web development and i dont really want to spend that much on a website and VPS. but ill probably repurchase my domain (with a different name)
For my CV or something idk.

**Note: I will make a ASP.NET website but not right now. This is just a demo of me testing HTML and CSS.**
