this is my first html & css project. and its in early stage, im making this as im learning new stuff about html and css. i know, my code is prolly shit, but ill fix that later on i learn more about it.

it was a dream for years to make a portfolio after seeing my friend make one. 

also its open source soo you can use it although its dog shit ðŸ˜­
